### Today's Readiness Assessment

**Readiness Score: 8/10**

Your sleep quality was reported as good with a duration of 8 hours and an HRV of 65, which suggests a well-recovered state. The moderate intensity run from three days ago indicates you have had sufficient recovery time, positioning you well for a workout today.

### Athlete Profile

Based on your recent workout data, you appear to be a **runner** with a focus on endurance and pace. Your 5km run at a 6:00 min/km pace suggests you're training for speed and distance, which aligns well with your upcoming half marathon and half Ironman events.

### Today's Workout Recommendation

Given your readiness and upcoming events, a focused workout to enhance your running efficiency would be beneficial:

**Workout:** Tempo Run
- **Duration:** 40 minutes
- **Description:** Start with a 10-minute warm-up at an easy pace. Then, run for 20 minutes at a steady tempo pace (around 5:45-6:00 min/km), focusing on maintaining a consistent effort. Finish with a 10-minute cool-down at an easy pace. This workout will help improve your lactate threshold and race pace for the half marathon.
